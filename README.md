# AnimeSearch
A way to search animes

# Description
This is a simple c++ application with an embedded database full of animes sorted by genres. You type in the genre you want thats on the list and the animes of that
genre will pop up.

# Installation and Running
To run this application you can use any C++ IDE of your choosing. compile the code in the `main.cpp` class

# Using the Program
The anime search is console based with an embedded database that shows a list of animes based off the genre. The animes also list the author, type, and the ID of the
anime in the database. This application is very basic and has lots of flaws that will be fixed in the future. Many contributions can be made to it.

# Contributions
There are a lot of areas to improve upon and to add in so this project is very flexible and can go in many directions. One way to contribute is to let users add animes
to the database.
